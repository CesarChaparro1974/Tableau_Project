# Saving SuperStore

## Overview
* The superstore is in peril! I have been hired as a consultant to review the superstore’s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.
For each question, you should prepare an individual visualization that justifies your conclusion.

### Part 1: Profits & losses
First, we'll try to identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore.

1. Among the pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) which are the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers? Justified conclusion with a visualization.
2. Which products should the superstore stop selling? Justified conclusion with a visualization.
3. Which product subcategories should the store focus on and which should they stop selling? There are 3 of each.



### Part 2: Advertising
* The superstore wants to know if advertising would be worth it. Advertising works over time and geography, and the average profit per unit sold should be high enough to justify it.

1. Identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in. There is a visualization of the average profit for each month of the year for those 3 states and argued how much we would be willing to pay in advertising for those states in those months.

### Part 3: Returned items

* In the last part, we’ll use the Returns table to see if some products have abnormal rates of being returned to the store.
* In a separate sheet, there is a visualization of the average profit against the average return rate on a dimension choosen (state, shipping mode, product type, etc.). I present a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.
